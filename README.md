Hi, Iâ€™m Sara. I am a  media &  consultant in Berlin, Germany, and on my way of becoming a web developer.

I am currently learning Fullstack Development at SPICED Academy because I am interested in how the web shapes culture through technology and design. In a previous life, I was a performance marketing specialist, cultural science student and writer.

âš¡ My simple pleasures are **money, power, and success**.
I identify as hungry.
